# Cluedo
The classic Cluedo board game prototype using swing library for the GUI.

This project was developed with 2 other programers, Biru Lin (https://github.com/Biru666) and Shiyi Liang.

This project is currently unfinished, the game requires an init input from the consol, the rest can be then played using the GUI.

This game assumes no one is allowed to see what other cards each players turn should have and only shows refute cards to one player.
